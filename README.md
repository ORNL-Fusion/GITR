# GITR
Global Impurity Transport Code

GITR is currently in the prototype phase of development for large scale simulation of plasma induced erosion, plasma transport of those impurities, self-sputtering, and redeposition.

The physics implemented in GITR is based on the trace-impurity assumption. i.e. The density of impurities created in the GITR code is negligible in its effect on the background plasma parameters.
