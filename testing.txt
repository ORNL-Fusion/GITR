How does an integrated test look. Exactly like
GITR.


Geometry check. 

  what does this do?

spectroscopy
  
  creates the histogram

cross field diffusion

particlespointer

What do I do... 

Check the changes in between the 2 branches.
Figure out what you want to merge in and what you don't.

I think branch organization needs to happen for sure.

config and unit_test should branch off of dev. Some of the changes in config should probably
go into dev. Actually... I'm wondering if all of them shouldn't...

Next:

1. Set up a unit test for cross field diffusion. Start pulling stuff in.
