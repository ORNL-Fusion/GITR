1. Load the CUDA module. Navigate to /home/share. You will see a file called env.fusiont6.
   > source env.fusiont6

2. From within GITR/build, run the build script "cmake.sh" provided in GITR root directory
   > cd build
   > bash ../cmake.sh

   note: some of the automatically installed dependencies must install things in system
         locations like /usr/local/lib. If you do not have permissions to create files there,
         the OS will say no and the build will fail.
         
         solution: sudo bash ../cmake.sh


3. run coulomb_tests
   > ./coulomb_tests
