# Straight Line Particle Track Tests/Examples
The straight line (neutral particle streaming) tests are formulated in order
to test geometry operations during development to make sure things don't break.
This makes up a handful of tests to see when/where particles intersec the surface
for different geometry types. These geometry types include:
1. 2D geometry bounded in the 3rd dimension
2. 2D geometry periodic in the 3rd dimension
3. 2D geometry using hash
4. 2D geometry cylindrical
5. 3D geometry
6. 3D geometry using hash
7. 3D geometry intersection with a vertex
