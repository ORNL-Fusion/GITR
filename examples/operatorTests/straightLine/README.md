# Straight Line Particle Track Tests/Examples
The straight line (neutral particle streaming) tests are formulated in order
to test geometry operations during development to make sure things don't break.
This makes up a handful of tests to see when/where particles intersec the surface
for different geometry types. These geometry types include:
1. 2D cube geometry bounded in the 3rd dimension
2. 2D cube geometry periodic in the 3rd dimension
3. 2D cube geometry cylindrical
4. 3D cube geometry
5. 3D geometry intersection with a vertex
6. 2D DIII-D geometry cylindrical
7. 2D DIII-D geometry cylindrical using hash
8. 3D DIII-D geometry using hash
