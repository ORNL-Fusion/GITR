#Straight Line Particle Track Tests/Examples
The straight line (neutral particle streaming) tests are formulated in order
to test geometry operations during development to make sure things don't break.
This makes up a handful of tests to see when/where particles intersec the surface
for different geometry types. These geometry types include:
2D geometry bounded in the 3rd dimension
2D geometry periodic in the 3rd dimension
2D geometry using hash
2D geometry cylindrical
3D geometry
3D geometry using hash
3D geometry intersection with a vertex
